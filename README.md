# MVC
MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, a design pattern used in software development, particularly in web and GUI applications. It separates an application into three interconnected components:

# Model
Manages the data and logic of the application.

# View
The user interface that displays the data.

# Controller
Handles the user input, updates the model, and refreshes the view. This separation improves code modularity, maintainability, and scalability.
